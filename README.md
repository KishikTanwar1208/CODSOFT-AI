# CODSOFT-AI INTERSHIP TASK 

Project-Tasks 
compeleted  the with help of Google Search ,readed tutorials and Watch videos from youtube 

TASK 1
CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
BuildED a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This  give  a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.

TASK 2
TIC-TAC-TOE AI
Implemented an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. And use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help us to  understand game theory and basic search
algorithms.

TASK 3
IMAGE CAPTIONING
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build
an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models
like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to
generate captions for those images.

TASK 4
RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
Created a simple recommendation system that suggests items to
users based on their preferences. And  use techniques like
collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.

TASK 5
FACE DETECTION AND
RECOGNITION
Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in
images or videos. Use a pre-trained face detection models like Haar
cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally
add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese
networks or ArcFace.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPRTUNITY LOOKING FORWARD TO WORK WITH  THE TEAM WITH NEW PROJECTS 
THANKU ONCE AGAIN FOR THE EFFORT AND RESPONSE FROM CODESOFT TEAM LEADER SIR
